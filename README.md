# LifeGuard: Health Monitoring and Emergency Response System 🚑💓

**"Empowering real-time health monitoring with intelligent emergency response."**

LifeGuard is a cutting-edge, IoT-enabled health monitoring system designed to provide real-time insights and proactive emergency alerts for heart patients and accident scenarios. This system leverages advanced sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud integration to monitor critical health parameters, visualize data interactively, and initiate life-saving responses.

## 🌟 **Key Features**

### 1. **Real-Time Health Monitoring**
- Tracks **heart rate**, **oxygen saturation (SpO2)**, and **motion data** using:
  - **MPU6050 Accelerometer (x2)** for motion and fall detection.
  - **MAX30102 Oximeter & Heart Rate Sensor** for pulse and SpO2 monitoring.
  - **Light Sensor** for environmental analysis.

### 2. **Emergency Alerts**
- **Abnormal Heart Rate Detection**: Instantly sends **Telegram alerts** to caregivers or emergency contacts.
- Designed for **critical heart patients** and accident scenarios to ensure timely intervention.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- Integrates with **Power BI** for interactive dashboards to analyze real-time and historical data trends.
- Easy-to-read insights for monitoring patient status over time.

### 4. **IoT Integration**
- Uses **ESP32** for seamless wireless communication to a remote server.
- **Flask API** to manage data storage and communication.

### 5. **Scalability and Future-Proofing**
- Designed for future enhancements:
  - **GPS Integration** for location tracking.
  - **Automated Emergency Calls** to nearby hospitals or police stations.

## 📊 **Project Architecture**

The LifeGuard system consists of three interconnected modules:

1. **Data Collection**:  
   - **STM32F401RE** gathers sensor data from MPU6050 (x2) and Light Sensor, forwarding it to the ESP32 via UART.
   - **ESP32** collects heart rate data from MAX30102.

2. **Data Transmission and Storage**:  
   - **ESP32** sends aggregated sensor data to a **Flask server** over Wi-Fi.
   - The server stores the data in an **SQL database**.

3. **Data Visualization and Alerts**:  
   - **Power BI Dashboards** for monitoring trends and real-time metrics.
   - **Telegram Alerts** for emergency conditions.

  - Early detection of heart abnormalities and timely alerts.
- **Accident Detection and Response**:
  - Real-time fall or collision detection with immediate alerts.
- **Elderly Care**:
  - Remote monitoring of elderly individuals' health and safety.

3. **Server Setup**:
   - Install Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install flask pyodbc
     ```
   - Run the Flask server:
     ```bash
     python Server_Code/app.py
     ```

4. **Power BI Setup**:
   - Import `PowerBI/Dashboard.pbix` into Power BI Desktop to visualize data.

5. **Testing**:
   - Monitor the system using Power BI dashboards.
   - Verify Telegram alerts for abnormal heart rate conditions.
